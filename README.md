# s/e/xy Reddit

Sexy Reddit embeds for Discord using Cloudflare Workers.

Simply replace the `e` in `reddit` with `xy` and you'll get a **_S E X Y_** Reddit embed! (or simply post a Reddit link on Discord and then send `s/e/xy` as your next message to automagically convert it :o)

Very much inspired by [tiktxk](https://github.com/Britmoji/tiktxk) by the folks at [Britmoji](https://github.com/Britmoji).
Also thanks to [Embedreddit](https://embedreddit.com/) which sadly is closed source and not actively maintained to my knowledge hence I'm building my own solution.
